### Strings

Perform the following tasks using string methods:

1. Reverse the string, `"bananas"`.
2. Return the substring, `"worry"`, from the string, `"What me worry?"`.
3. Convert the string, `"90210"`, to an integer.
4. Capitalize the letter `"t"`, in the string, `"tony"`.

### Arrays

Perform the following tasks using array methods (note: you might also need to use some string methods):

1. Given the array `numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, create a new array with each element of `numbers` multiplied by three.
2. Given the array `instructors = ["McKenneth", "Hari", "Will", "Tony"], return a new array with only the instructors whose name is exactly four characters long.  
3. Given an array, `class_topics = ["backbone", "express", "javascript", "node", "ruby"]`
Print the following statements:
```ruby
"I learn Backbone in WDI."
"I learn Express in WDI."
"I learn Javascript in WDI."
"I learn Node in WDI."
"I learn Ruby in WDI."
```

&nbsp;4. Given the following array (of arrays):
```ruby
sandwiches_with_costs = [["blt", 5], ["grilled cheese", 7], ["turkey_club_with_pesto", 9], ["ramenburger", 6], ["portobello and spicy sauce compote", 10]]
```
Create a hash using sandwich names as keys and cost amounts as values. 

**BONUS**: Change the sandwich names from strings to symbols and use these symbols instead. Remember to replace spaces with underscores when you move from strings to symbols.

### Hashes

Perform the following tasks using hash methods (note: you might also need to use some string and array methods).

Given the hash:
```ruby
breakfast_prefs = {
	juice: "orange",
	syrup: "blueberry",
	potatoes: "steak fries",
	meat: "corned beef hash",
	carb: "Texas Toast"
	cups_of_coffee: 3,
	vegan: false
}
```
1. Return an array containing only the keys of `breakfast_prefs`.
2. Return an array containing only the values of `breakfast_prefs`.
3. Change the value of `:syrup` to `"boysenberry"`.
4. Return a hash with the key-value pairs whose value is of type string.
