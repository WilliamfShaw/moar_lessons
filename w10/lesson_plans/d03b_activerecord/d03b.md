# ActiveRecord

## Learning Objectives

- Utilize an ORM in Ruby to manage a database
	- Define a model in ActiveRecord
	- Define a class method on our Model
	- Define an instance method on our Model
	- Define relationships using ActiveRecord
		- one to many
		- many to many

## Outline

`gem install activerecord`

### What is Active Record?

- A ruby ORM that allows us to manage our database, table associations and data
- Since it is built with Ruby that means it is blocking
	- no more call back hell!
- Works just like sequelize and has a very similar API

### Connect to the database

Create a file called `database_config.rb`

First we require the active_record library code. Then we use ActiveRecord::Base, a module defined as a part of ActiveRecord, to configure our database connection. We add the host, database name, and adapter (similar to dialect in sequelize)

```
require 'active_record'

ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection({
	host: 'localhost',
	database: 'sandbox',
	adapter: 'postgresql'
})

```

### Define a model

```
mkdir models
touch models/user.rb
```

In the file user.rb

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

So what's up with that weird `<` symbol?

#### Inheritance

That `<` allows us to add further functionality to our regular Ruby class.

ActiveRecord::Base has all of the methods that allow us to map a database table to a ruby class.
To take advantage of that we ask our User class to 'inherit' from ActiveRecord::Base.

### Playground
`ruby seed.rb` -> don't look just yet

Make a new file `playground.rb`

```
require 'pry'
require_relative 'database_config'
require_relative 'models/user'

binding.pry
```

### Methods

#### Class Methods
`.first`
`.last`
`.all` -> User.all
`.where({ attr: value })` -> User.where({ age: 50 }), User.where('age < ?', 52)
`.find(id)` -> User.find(5)
`.find_by({ attr: value })` -> User.find_by({ name: 'McKenneth' })
`.find_or_create_by(attrs)`
`.destroy(id) or .destroy([id1, id2, id3])`
	- will destroy the specific models
  - we dont want to do this -> delete through our object not the class
`.destroy_all`

# BREAK

#### Instance Methods

All table attributes will be added as instance methods!

`.update(attrs)`
	- returns true if updated
	- false if not
`.destroy`
	- returns the object that was destroyed
	- false if not

# PRACTICE

-> create a new database: `createdb wham_rental_db`

##### Building
- building_number
- street_name
- city
- state
- zip_code
- floors

##### Apartment
- apartment_number
- vacant
- bedrooms
- bathrooms
- building_id

##### Owner
- first_name
- last_name

-> Define a sql file to create the following table

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS apartments;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS buildings_owners;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS buildings;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS owners;

CREATE TABLE owners(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(255),
	last_name VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE buildings(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	building_number integer,
	street_name VARCHAR(255),
	city VARCHAR(255),
	state VARCHAR(255),
	zip_code INTEGER,
	floors INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE apartments(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	apartment_number VARCHAR(255),
	bedrooms INTEGER,
	bathrooms INTEGER,
	vacant BOOLEAN,
	building_id INTEGER REFERENCES buildings
);

CREATE TABLE buildings_owners(
	building_id INTEGER REFERENCES buildings,
	owner_id INTEGER REFERENCES owners
);

```

### Configuration

```
require 'active_record'

ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection({
	host: 'localhost',
	database: 'wham_rental_db',
	adapter: 'postgresql'
})

```

### Models

Define the models for the apartments, buildings, and owners table.

### Main

Create a main.rb file and require all of the necessary files and libraries.
Place a binding.pry at the bottom of this file

# BREAK

# Relationships made easy

#### one - many

in `apartment.rb` -> `belongs_to :building`
in `building.rb` -> `has_many :apartments`

This will set up the relationships on the ruby level. Now we have access to a slew of methods that active record provides

- `apartment_obj.building`
- `building_obj.apartments`

Make a new apartment
Make a new building
Add the apartment to the new building

```
new_apt = Apartment.create({ apartment_number: '1A', bedrooms: 1, bathrooms: 5, vacant: true})
new_building = Building.create({ building_number: 5, street_name: 'Sesame Street', city: 'New York', state: 'NY', zip_code: 12345, floors: 9001 })

new_building.apartments #=> []
new_apt.building
new_building.apartments << new_apt

new_apt.building
new_building.apartments

new_building.apartments.include? new_apt
```

#### many - many

in `building.rb` -> `has_and_belongs_to_many :owners`
in `owner.rb` -> `has_and_belongs_to_many :buildings`

run `main.rb` again
Make two new owners
Make a new building

```
new_building = Building.create({ building_number: 7, street_name: 'Dreary Lane', city: 'Brooklyn', state: 'NY', zip_code: 11111, floors: 9002 })

owner_one = Owner.create({ first_name: 'McKenneth', last_name: 'Scott III' })
owner_two = Owner.create({ first_name: 'Hari', last_name: 'Mohanraj' })
owner_one.buildings
owner_two.buildings

first_building = Building.first
owner_one.buildings << first_building
owner_one.buildings << new_building

owner_two << new_building

first_building.owners
new_building.owners

```

Run the seed file `ruby seed.rb`
Run `ruby main.rb`

# BREAK

### Instance Methods
- Apartment
  - details
    - returns a string with the apartment details and whether it is rented or not
- Building
  - details
    - returns a string with the buildings details
- Owner
  - full_name

### Class Methods

# self! WHO IS SELF

- Apartment
  - vacancies
    - returns an array of all vacant apartments
  - rented
    - returns an array of all rented apartments
- Building
  - locations
    - returns an array of all buildings details

# Break

# MAYBE EXERCISE

- Build models and add the appropriate relationships for the bloggr_sql_db you used this morning
- Use pry to play around with the models and see that you get back the appropriate date

Are learning objectives present and complete?
What is the ratio of talking vs. doing? (60/40, TT/ST-wg vs ST-sg / individual)
What is the level of engagement?
Are exercise plans present?
