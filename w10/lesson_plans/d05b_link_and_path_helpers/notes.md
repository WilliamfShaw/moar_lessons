# Path and Link Helpers

## Learning Objectives

## Outline

* `rake routes` - talk about prefix
  * append `_path` to those prefixes!
* `binding.pry` somewhere
* I refactor paths in the controller to use path helpers
* You go through views and refactor them

**BREAK**

Great! Now look at all those `<a>` tags. Yuck. Let's refactor.

**I do**

Refactor one of the links on the index page

**You do**

* Refactor the other links on the index page
* Add a link to the `new` page to go back to the `index` page
* Add a link to the `edit` page to go back to the `show` page

# Lesson Plan - Review Notes

Are learning objectives present and complete?
What is the ratio of talking vs. doing? (60/40, TT/ST-wg vs ST-sg / individual)
What is the level of engagement?
Are exercise plans present?
Any pitfalls with the exercises?
