# Iterators

## Learning Objectives

- Use iterators to iterate over the values of an array
	- `.each`
	- `.map`
	- `.select`
	- `.reject`
	- `.reduce`
- Explore documentation
	- Arrays
	- Ranges
	- Hashes
	- Strings
	- Numbers
- Practice writing algorithms in Ruby

## Outline

### each

- used like forEach in javascript but with a slightly different syntax
- no callbacks!

```
[1, 2, 3, 4].each do |num|
	puts "The number is #{num}"
end
```

- we define a block do..end
	- the block accepts an argument, a single element of the array
	- the action is performed inside of the block
	- the original array is returned when the block finishes executing

### map

```
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

capitalized_letters = letters.map do |letter|
	# gonna store the upcased version of this letter
	letter.upcase
end

capitalized_letters
```

# Exercise
Given the following array of arrays:
```ruby
[["hari", 50, "sananab"], ["sarah", 42, "netulg"], ["mckenneth",9001,"poop"]]
```

Iterate through the array. The output of every iteration should be the following:
- The first element of the array, capitalized, labeled as name
- The second element of the array, labeled as age
- The third element of the array, reversed, labeled as favorite word

# Break

### You Do 10 mins

- look at the ruby docs for the select and reject and reduce array methods

### I Do 5 mins
- illustrate the use of select, reject and reduce

```
evens = [1,2,3,4].select do |num|
	num % 2 == 0
end

odds = [1,2,3,4].reject { |num| num % 2 == 0 }

sum = [1,2,3,4].reduce(:+)

```

# Iterators

>Given the following nested collection:

```
pokemon =
[
  {
    name: "Bulbasaur",
    national_id: 1,
    sp_atk: 65,
    sp_def: 65,
    species: "seed pokemon",
    speed: 45,
    types: {
      type_a: "grass",
      type_b: "poison"
    },
    weight: "15.2lbs"
  },
  {
    name: "Charmander",
  	national_id: 4,
  	pkdx_id: 4,
  	sp_atk: 60,
  	sp_def: 50,
  	species: "flammable pokemon",
  	speed: 65,
  	types: {
  		type_a: "fire",
      type_b: "lizard"
  	},
  	weight: "85lbs"
  },
  {
    name: "Squirtle",
  	national_id: 7,
  	pkdx_id: 7,
  	sp_atk: 50,
  	sp_def: 64,
  	species: "water pokemon",
  	speed: 43,
  	types: {
			type_a: "water",
      type_b: "turtle"
  	},
	  weight: "90lbs"
  }
]
```

> Write a program that will return a string with the following information:
- The name of each Pokemon and it's ID number separated by a `|`
- The species with every word capitalized and the weight separated by a `|`
- The types separated by a `//`

**Example**:

```bash
Bulbasaur | 1
Species: Seed Pokemon | Weight: 15.2lbs
Types: grass // poison
```

# Luhn
Credit card numbers can be validated with a process called the Luhn algorithm. Simply stated, the Luhn algorithm works like this:

1. Starting with the next to last digit and continuing with every other digit going back to the beginning of the card, double the digit.

2. Sum all doubled and untouched digits in the number.

3. If that total is a multiple of 10, the number is valid.

For example, given the card number 4408 0412 3456 7893:

```
Orig  :  4 4 0 8 0 4 1 2 3 4   5 6   7 8   9 3
Step 1:  8 4 0 8 0 4 2 2 6 4  10 6  14 8  18 3
Step 2:  8+4+0+8+0+4+2+2+6+4+1+0+6+1+4+8+1+8+3 = 70
Step 3:  70 % 10 == 0
```

> Write a program that will prompt the user to input a credit card number. If it is valid then the program should return "Valid card number, thank you", if it is not valid the program should return "Invalid credit card number!"

> 1234567890123456 #should be false
  4408041234567893 #should be true
  38520000023237 #should be true
  4222222222222 #should be true

> https://projecteuler.net/problem=13
	num.reduce(:+).to_s[0..9]

> https://projecteuler.net/problem=16
	(2**1000).to_s.split('').map {|num| num.to_i }.reduce(:+)
