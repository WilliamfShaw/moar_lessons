##### cue Coldplay

Today you are going to build a clock!

Start by planning! Draw a clock, break down the problem,

### Step 1
Define 3 variables and grab the associated element from the DOM using jQuery:
- minuteHand
- secondHand
- hourHand

### Step 2
- Using setInterval and jQuery make the second hand make a full rotation in 60 seconds.
- You will have to utilize the css attribute `transform - rotate`.

### Step 3
- Make the minute hand make a full rotation in 1 hour - (decrease the length of each setInterval time if you want ot see your clock move more quickly).

### Step 4
- Make the hour hand make a full rotation in 12 hours

### BONUS
- Sync up your clock with the current time.
- Take a look at the JavaScript `Date` object
- Think about how you can change the time interval to make the second hand move more smoothly.
