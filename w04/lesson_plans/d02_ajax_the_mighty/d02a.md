# APIs

## Learning Objectives

- Explain what an API is
- Explore documentation for an API
- Make a request to a web API for data

## Outline

### What is an API?

### What are some of the API's that we've used already?

- jQuery
- Github -> submit_hw, push/pull
- Command Line

### What are the different types of APIs that exist?

- command line api's
- framework api's
- language api's
- web api's

### What is a Web API?

- Web-based api that defines a series of defined endpoints on a server, that return data based on parameters that you provide.
- The endpoints are defined by the creator of the application

- Generally, provide access to the application's data source (database of information)

### Well Known web apis?

- twitter
- facebook
- foursquare
- google (search, places, maps, docs, drive, fusion tables)
- soundcloud

### But why?

- Can take advantage of other people's data and services that we can use to make applications
- Can build applications that do not need to have a robust backend or a backend at all -> all data is available remotely

- Exposure and more data for the company that provide's the data
- Money, charge for the data!

### Explore giphy documentation

**10 minutes** read through the giphy api wiki

** 20 minutes talk about the docs **

### Make a request to giphy

**CURL - command line tool that allows us to make http requests **

- `curl -v http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC`

- Look at the meta-data
	- request type - GET
	- endpoint - API ENDPOINT
	- protocol - HTTP/1.1
	- host - api.giphy.com
	- status codes
		- 200 OK
		- 404 Not Found
		- 302 Redirect
		- 500 Internal Server Error
- Look at the response
	- content type
	- content length
	- response

# JSON - What is it?

- just a way of structuring data
- based on the structure of JavaScript's objects: key-value data pairs
- highly flexible and relatively language agnostic (most programming languages have some level of JSON support)
- sent as a string

# Copy and paste the JSON reponse and store in a variable in the console `var api = RESPONSE`

- can immediately use the response as if it were a normal JS object
- parse through the response
- can access properties using dot notation

# Use the data!

- `$('<img>').attr('src', api.data.image_url).appendTo('body')`

Are learning objectives present and complete?
What is the ratio of talking vs. doing? (60/40, TT/ST-wg vs ST-sg / individual)
What is the level of engagement?
Are exercise plans present?
Any pitfalls with the exercises?
