# JS Track

Thoughts behind this:

- Allows for multiple passes/reinforcement of crucial concepts.
- Focuses on adding tools as needed to solve a problem
- Backbone early -> do it A LOT (could effectively separate the backbone router from anything server related)
- Front End before Back End -> Focus on one domain at a time!
- Postgres DB -> stick with what you know!
