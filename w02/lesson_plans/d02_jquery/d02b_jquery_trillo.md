# TRILLO

## Learning Objectives

**First**
- recap all the methods we used in the morning
- children, find, eq, parent, closest
- create dom elements
- Practice using jQuery to manipulate the DOM

**Then**
- Use jQuery to create DOM representations of JS objects
- use jQuery to create a TodoList

## Outline

# REVIEW MORNING -> ASK FOR QUESTIONS

jQuery DOM manipulation ex - 30 minutes to do, 30 minutes to review

#BREAK

# SHAPESHIFTER



# WALKING PONY - 20 minutes
```
Using setTimeout and jQuery, manipulate the CSS of the div with the id of pony so that it trots across the screen.
All CSS has been provided
```

# TRILLO

Introduce Trillo

Look at the HTML provided.

What are we going to do?

- Write two functions:

## `renderAllItems`
- Should iterate over an array of item objects passing each to the renderSingleItem function

## `renderSingleItem`
- Should build the following HTML structure for a todo:

```
<li class="item todo">
	<p>Wrap things in ca$h</p>
	<span class="label">Mark as Done</span>
</li>
```

- Should build the following HTML structure for a done item:

```
<li class="item done">
	<p>Learn JavaScript</p>
	<span class="label">Remove</span>
</li>
```

If the TODO is done, the `li` tag should have a class of 'done', it is is not complete it should have a class of 'todo'
The content of the `p` tag should be the description of the todo item
The label should depend on whether the todo is done or not.

Completed TODOs should be appended to the done list's `ul`
CURRENT TODOS should be appened to the todo list's `ul`

# THEN

- add a new item

- remove an item

- mark as done
