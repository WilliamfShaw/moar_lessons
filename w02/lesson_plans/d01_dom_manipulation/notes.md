# DOM Manipulation

## Learning Objectives

* Explain what the document object model is
* Access elements in the DOM
* Add and remove elements to the DOM
* Edit existing elements in the DOM

## Outline

### The Document Object Model

**I do**

* What is the DOM?
  * It is the tree that our browser constructs based on our HTML
  * We can traverse and manipulate this tree through JavaScript

### Doc Dive

**We do**

Break up class into groups
Each group researches one method on MDN
Regroup and have one team member demo their method on instructor computer

* Search
  * document.getElementById
  * document.getElementsByClassName
* Creation
  * document.createElement
  * document.createTextNode
* Traversal
  * node.childNodes
  * node.children
* DOM editing
  * node.appendChild
  * node.remove
* Node editing
  * node.innerHTML
  * node.id
  * node.classList
  * node.setAttribute

**You do**

* Access text of the heading
* Access the text of the first paragraph
* Add a fourth list item. Make sure it has the right class
* Remove the second list item
* Remove the entire list
* Change the heading's text to say "I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse"
* BONUS: Can you make the paragraphs red?
* BONUS: Can you change the font of the heading to Arial?

* Great. Now that we've seen all these suite methods, let's put our code into a JS file, so we don't have to type it in the console each time
* What happened? Oh my god! *window.onload*
