The New York Knicks need help.  They need some new talent, a new coach, a new everything, to be a great team.  Follow these steps below to make it happen!

## New Coach

1. Create a `<div>` element, save it to a variable called 'newCoach' and give it the class of 'coach'
1. Append the coach div to the body.

## New Header

1. Create two new elements, an `<h1>` saved to the variable 'topLevelHeader' and a `<span>` with the variable 'span'
1. Give the span the textContent of "New New York Knicks".
1. Give the span the class of 'shadowed'
1. Append the span to the topLevelHeader.
1. Append the topLevelHeader to the body.

## New Roster

1. Create a `ul` element and save it to a variable named newRoster.
1. Uncomment the `newKnicks` array. Iterate through the array, and create an li for each knick. Give each `<li>` the class of 'newKnicks', the id of each player's LAST NAME and the text value of the player's full name. Append this li to the ul created above.  
1. append the `ul` to the DOM.
1. Add 5 more elements (each of a different tag) to the DOM so that the court is more awesome. Feel free to get creative with the css.
