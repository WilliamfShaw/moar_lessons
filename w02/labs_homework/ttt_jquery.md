* Appreciate the modularity of Object-Oriented Programming

### Steps

* Copy the starter code from the INSTRUCTOR folder
  * Use the existing starter game, board
  * **Go through the existing files to understand how they work**

* Create a new `app.js` file and link it to your `index.html`
  * write the appropriate code in `app.js` to achieve the following
  * When I click on a square, I want to see my piece placed in it (add text to the right div)
  * Consecutive clicks should alternately place X's and O's in the squares you click
  * I want to see whose turn it currently is, display this at the bottom of the board.
  * When I click a filled square, nothing should happen (the game should not break)
  * X's and O's should be two different colors
  * The page should start with a single button "Start Game", clicking this button should generate the visual board.
