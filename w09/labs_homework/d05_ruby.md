In preparation, please spend the weekend exploring some of the resources below. Focus on topics like Data Types, Functions, and Syntax (especially as it compares to JS):

- [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/), Chapters 1-8
- [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer)
- [Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)
- [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- [Ruby Docs](http://ruby-doc.org/)

Good luck in your exploration and be ready to write some suite Ruby Codes Monday morning!
