Adonis

MyFirstDate

- More intro as to what this app does/is for/who user's are, etc.

- Could be tighter

- Nya doesn't sound like he understands what the Router is for -- initialize

- Working router +++

- Not enough idea as to how the code works overall (what's cool v. what is standard boilerplate-ish stuff)

- What is exit doing? (i think modal view..?)

- Build the base maybe could be a lil tighter (but would have to look at the code).

450 lines of code factual 

$and -sqlize --NONO factual.  

Kraken

EventEaze

- Boom! 

- Presenting Locally.  

- Some templating issues in the description

- Hammered.  

Oh I get event ease now -- Booze.

- Nice flow, kept us engaged, got the point. --until the code.  

- didn't protect keys.

- the code you showed is complex and a little hard to follow -- a good sign to add comments (good for explanation also).

- Could balance presentation more between members.  

- Like the many-to-many talk.  

- Seemed to understand their use of Google Maps

Warhammer

Vimodoro

- Good lead-in and contextualization of project purpose.  

- Creative project idea.  

- Like that Start button doesn't work without options being set.

- Generally well organized code (whitespace etc --but 4 space tabs :[ ).

- $.cookie

- animate css.  

Thundercats

JackSoundFactory

- And it works!

- Demoed very good.  

- "The men go straight for the juggular."

- Reload the page to get saved tracks - :/

- Admitting turmoil in the process - at least with the Web Audio API

- the Visualizer via canvas. 

- Comments to explain what things are doing. 

- Javascript Events, intrestingly explained.  

- Explained fairly well.  

- presented local

- big WIN re: backbone

Gaia

MetApp

- Not sure where to go.

- Face the crowd.

- Demo could be tighter.  

- Newb Newbowitz

- Art Modal view why letter T?

- Be more confident....a little aimless with the code presentations.  

- Router ++, well used.  

- 2 different Database systems dealt with.

Nimbus

TravelPlannr

- One person gets created, but listed twice.  

- Maxed out our API....

- Keys in the open

- Nested View structure - interesting - look more later.

- Not certain about what code is doing?  Not thought well about what code to show, hmm....

- Presentation was not well delegated.  

- Jump more into the Google Maps Module you used, that was kinda interesting.  

- API requests talk about rate limiting.

- Seemed siloed throughout the process - lessons learned.

- Didn't seem like they all know the code.  

- Google Maps SS v CS eventually got an answer but a little flippant at first.  

Styx

Frigdly

- Fun presentation demo

- Advanced Search cool.

- How did the sliders work?

- What are Mark and Matt doing?

- Why es or s?

- Variables are not named well.  Too many i's, j's, k's, etc., a's, b's, h's.

- Code seems fragile (but at least they acknowledged this).

Midas

Rozay_N_Ur_Resume

- Description of job appears a bit wonkily

- Like that Ricky Ross.

- Liked moving those Feeds to a module.

- Passing callbacks around.

- Could have maybe made some of the feed modules drier.  

- Interesting explanation of count instead of find.

- Craigslist not on Amazon Web Services.

- Modals - Still struggled with it so implementing a lot in project.  

- trello, sounded good.  

- sounded like they balanaced well across the stack.

- Four Star Method...Would want to learn more about that.  

Chronos

featur

- Like the energy

- A few bugs 

- Spotify Plugin... what about it?  

- like how you explained your design choice RE: having one route that returns everything.  

- Also explained the Spotify API album limit (50 in total but only 20 at a time).  

- Parse the API return and come back with an object of what you actually need.  

- Fun with control flows to build up your return data, also liked the comments.  

- many-to-many
