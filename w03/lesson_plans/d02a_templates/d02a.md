# HTML Templates

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the benefit of using HTML templates
* Utilize Handlebars templates to generate HTML

## Outline

**I do**

We want to make this

```html
<li class="todo">
  Wash the dog
  <span class="finish">Mark As Done</span>
  <span class="delete">X</span>
</li>
```

We could do this like this

```js
var makeTodo = function(content) {
  return $('<li>').addClass('todo')
                  .text(content)
                  .append($('<span>').addClass('finish')
                                     .text('Mark As Done'))
                  .append($('<span>').addClass('delete')
                                     .text('X'));  
};
```

What sucks about this? It's hard to get an idea of what's the output html looks
like! Let's fix that.

```js
var makeTodo = function(content) {
  var htmlString = '<li class="todo">' +
                     content +
                     '<span class="finish">Mark As Done</span>' +
                     '<span class="delete">X</span>' +
                   '</li>';
  return htmlString;
};
```

Template time! I set up a handlebars template to achieve the same, **using docs**

* Handlebars from cdnjs
* Create template in script tag
* Find the template's html in your JS
* Use the html to generate a `template` function
* Call the template function to generate HTML

**You do**

Add another template for blargh posts. It should look like this

```html
<h1 class="post-title">This Is The Title</h1>
<h4 class="post-author">By Author Name</h4>
<p class="post-content">
  This is a pretty schweet blargh, right?
</p>
```

# Lesson Plan - Review Notes

Are learning objectives present and complete?
What is the ratio of talking vs. doing? (60/40, TT/ST-wg vs ST-sg / individual)
What is the level of engagement?
Are exercise plans present?
Any pitfalls with the exercises?
