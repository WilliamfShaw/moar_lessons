Delivery Tips:

* Think about how long you're talking
* Move quicker sooner, slower later
* Cold Call more often
* Revisit LOs
* Defer questions when appropriate

# Agile Software Development

## Learning Objectives
* Describe Agile Software Development Methodology
* Compare and Contrast with Waterfall Development Methodology (Pros-Cons)
* What is a User Story?
* How do we use Project Tracking?
* What is an MVP?
* How do Agile Teams work together (Standup/Scrum/Retrospective)?
* How do Agile Teams timebox their work cycles (Sprint/Spike)?
* but Why? - Many/most Softwafe Developers work on teams that utilize facets of Agile.  Becoming familiar with these practices are important to job life as a developer.  
## Outline

Agile is a Software Development Methodology focused on producing software that is useable for customers quickly and then iterating on feedback from these releases.  Improvements are introduced quickly and frequently based upon continuous feedback.  

Waterfall Software Development Methodology focused on following a plan and developing a piece of software to its completion.  A project is Defined-Designed-Implemented-Tested-Maintained.  Originated from construction/manufacturing industries where after-the-fact changes are prohibitively expensive.  

Pros

* Releasing a product means it is more quickly at market.
* Getting user feedback quickly can allow for improvement/product adaptation more efficiently.
* A months-long 'plan' may not be adaptive enough for exogenous factors.

Cons

* Technical Debt - focusing on having 'working code' for a short-term sprint can produce code that becomes harder to work with moving forward.
* Inefficient in large organizations - can be difficult to have very large teams shift quickly and just lead to more confusion.
* Documentation for software is not prioritized.

# Lesson Plan - Review Notes

Are learning objectives present and complete?
What is the ratio of talking vs. doing? (60/40, TT/ST-wg vs ST-sg / individual)
What is the level of engagement?
Are exercise plans present?
Any pitfalls with the exercises?
