# Project Euler

## Objectives 
* Problem Modeling Reps
* Core Javascript Practice

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a site hosting hundreds of math problems designed to be solved with code.  These problems are great for working in reps of coding fundamentals and basic language syntax.  

Today we are going to work on [Problem 6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6).

##Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
