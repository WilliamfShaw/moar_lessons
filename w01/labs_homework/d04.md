# WHAMTA beta 0.0.3

WHAMTA has fallen victim to Thomas Gabriel (GDtDH villain).  Gabriel used his super virus to turn off every computer in the world and shut down WHAMTA!

Thankfully, John McClane kicked some tush and took out Gabriel BUT WHAMTA needs some help to get back on track.

Your assignment for this evening is to rebuild WHAMTA.

## Step 1

Create a function to build new WHAMTA subway lines, called `lineFactory`.  This function should take two arguments, the name of a line as a string and an array of station names (strings).  The function should return a line object with the following attributes and behaviors:

**Attributes**

* `name` - string, name of the line (can be one character)
* `stations` - array of station names

**Behaviors**

* `listStations()`
  * logs all the stations on the line to the console.
* `addstation(newStation)` - adds a new station to the line.  Takes the new station's name as a string.
* `stopsBtwnStations(stationStart, stationEnd)` - logs the number of stops between two stations to the console. Takes two arguments, stationStart and stationEnd as the endpoints of the trip.

## Step 2

Create an object called `whamtaSystem`.  This will represent the entire WHAMTA System.  The object should have the following attributes and behaviors:

**Attributes**

* `lines` : an object literal with the line names as a property and a line object as a value.

**Behaviors**

* `linenames()`: logs all of the line names in WHAMTA to the console.
* `addLine(lineName, arrayOfStationNames)`: adds a new line to the system with station names.  Takes two arguments, the name of the new line and an array of the stations on that line.

## Step 3

Create a `menu` function.  This function should control the flow of our WHAMTA App.  Here is the experience your user should have.  

1.  Give the user the choice to view lines, edit lines, or quit.
2.  If a user chooses to view lines, log all line names to the console.
* Then allow the user to choose a specific line to see all stations on that line.
* Then allow the user to find the number of stations between two stations.
3.  If a user chooses to edit lines, let them choose to add a new station to an existing line or add a new line.
4.  Let the program run AND REFLECT ALL LINE CHANGES until the program is QUIT.
