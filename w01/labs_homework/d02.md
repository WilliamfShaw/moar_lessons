Great job with last night's homework.  Unfortunately, Simon Gruber (DHwAV villain) destroyed a great deal of WHAMTA [today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a4arotvSX8).

Thankfully, John McClane salvaged some of WHAMTA and there was no loss of life.

Your assignment for this evening is to rebuild WHAMTA.

#### Step 1 - Modeling

>    'A big part of programming is the act of structured critical thinking about a problem.' 
>    --Hari Mohanraj

Before starting to code tonight, take some time to answer the following questions in a markdown/text file.  

- What were some of the issues with your first iteration of WHAMTA?
  - Is there a lot of repeated code?
  - How flexible is the code? (How would it respond to changes in the future?)
  - Where do you see room for improvement?
  - What are the nouns for this problem domain? What real-world objects are we
  trying to represent through our code?
- In programming, what purpose/uses do arrays have?
- How can we use arrays to better represent the data we use in WHAMTA?

#### Step 2 - Code

Let's start by meeting the final specs of last night's homework, but using some new tools!

- When the program begins a menu should be prompted displaying:
  - A list of three trains - `The (L) Train, The (N) Train, The (S)ix Train`
  - A statement asking the user to make their selection
- When the user enters: `L`
  - The console should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as a train
  - The second console output should contain the following:
    - `8th Ave`
    - `6th Ave`
    - `Union Square`
    - `3rd Ave`
    - `1st Ave`
    - `Bedford Ave`
- When the user enters: `N`
  - The console should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as a train
  - The second console output should contain the following:
    - `Times Square`
    - `Herald Square`
    - `28th St`
    - `23rd St - WHAM Nexus`
    - `Union Square`
    - `8th St `
- When the user enters `S`
  - The console should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as a train
  - The second console output should contain the following:
    - `Grand Central`
    - `33rd St`
    - `28th St`
    - `23rd St`
    - `Union Square`
    - `Astor Place`

- A Thank You message should be logged to the console.
- The program should exit.

#### Step 3 - More functionality

- Rather than exit after the program is run, let's allow WHAMTA users to use our program until they choose to quit. 
  - This quit option should be accessible when users can choose a train line.
  - When the user quits, the program should alert the user than the program has ended.  
  - Think about tools that we have learnt today that let processes recur until something has happened (or while something remains true).  

#### WHAMTA BONUS
    
- Add an option to add new stations to our lines at WHAMTA.  
  - Give users this option after they select a line and have the station names logged to the console. 
  - If the user selects to add a station...
    - Prompt the user to input a station name.
    - Log a message to the console that the station name has been saved.
    - When the user selects to look at this line again, the new station should be present.
  - If the user selects not to add a station...
    - Return the user to the main menu.
