* Make a Stopwatch in the browser
* Reps with [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval#Example) and [clearInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/clearInterval)


### Time out

* As a user, I want a stopwatch to count timed passed second-by-second, so that I can track time passage.
* As a user, I want to stop the counter so that I can time specific events.
* As a user, I want to reset the counter so that I can start counting again from 0.
