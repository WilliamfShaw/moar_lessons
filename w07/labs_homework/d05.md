WHAMco is always iterating, always disrupting.  So logically, we are entering the world of online commercial banking.  WHAMBank - Bank of WHAM app is our latest venture.  It will be developed based on the following specifications:


## User Stories

**As a user, I want to be able to sign-up, so that I may have access to my banking profile.**

**As a user, I want to be able to log-in, so that only I may view my banking profile.**

**As a user, I want to be able to change my username and password, so that I may ensure the security of my account.**

**As a user, I want to be able to delete my profile, so that I may close my accounts with WHAMBank.**

**As a user, I want to have a checking account and savings account when I create my profile, so that I can begin banking upon sign up.**

**As a user, I want to be able to see my account balances and account types when I log-in, so that I can review my banking profile.**

**As a user, I want to be able to deposit funds to my checking and savings accounts, so that I may save my money.**

**As a user, I want to be able to withdraw funds from my checking and savings accounts, so that I may take money out of my accounts.**

**As a user, I want overdraft protection so that I can pay my bills even when my checking account balance falls low.  (Specifically, shortfalls in my checking account will trigger the difference to be withdrawn from savings). 

Example: I have $10 in savings and $5 in checking.  I try to withdraw $6 from checking. $5 out of the $6 will come out of my checking account. The remaining $1 will come out of my savings account. My final balances are $9 in savings and $0 in checking.  

**As a user, I want to never have my balances fall below 0, so that I never have negative amounts of money in my accounts.** 

Example 1: I have $10 in savings and $5 in checking.  I try to withdraw $26 from checking.  This withdrawal is not permitted, as I do not have enough funds in both accounts put together; my balances remain unchanged.  

Example 2: I have $10 in savings and $5 in checking.  I try to withdraw $11 from savings. This withdrawal is not permitted, since only the savings account can provide protection against the checking account, and not the other way around; my balances remain unchanged.   

> Note: The logic regarding account balances may be implemented on the front-end.  If you feel very comfortable with this, try to implement this logic on your back-end, so that our server also validates account information.  

## Models

### User
`first_name`
`last_name`
`username`
`password_digest`

### Accounts
`account_type` (a string to denote what type of account this is; `'checking'` or `'savings'`)
`balance` (an integer to reflect whole dollars in an account).

Users have many Accounts.  When a User signs up, a User is given a Checking Account and a Savings Account.
